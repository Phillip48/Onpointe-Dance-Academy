                    <p>Brianna Roman started in 2009 with only 7 students. Its purpose was to bring dance to the local schools, giving opportunities to all students to be able to dance, and continues to do so. It has since multiplied and she has been teaching the love of dance in the Orlando area. We teach all styles of dance from Ballet, tap, jazz, hip hop, tumbling, and contemporary, to ethnic dances like Latin, African, and Bollywood. We continue to teach dance at local schools, but has since found a place to call home at 11184 South Apopka Vineland Rd. This location has allowed the academy to grow and open more opportunities. The academy now has 4 performance teams starting at age 5. These teams perform at local events including Disney and Orlando Magic. The academy as well has a competition company that competes at competitions around the central florida area. Whether on our teams or recreational classes performances here at On Pointe are an important key to our program. Children await them with confidence and enthusiasm. The goal of On pointe dance academy is being accomplished by opening opportunities for all children to explore the world of dance through expression, and creativity. Dance is more than the word it is a sport and an art all in one.</p>
