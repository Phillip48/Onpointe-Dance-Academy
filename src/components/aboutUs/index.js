                        <p>Brianna Roman started in 2009 with only 7 students. Its purpose was to bring dance to the local schools, giving opportunities to all students to be able to dance, and continues to do so. It has since multiplied and has been teaching the love of dance in the areas of Kissimmee and Orlando. We teach all styles of dance from Ballet, tap, jazz, hip hop, tumbling, and contemporary, to ethnic dances like Latin, African, and Bollywood. All props and mats are part of the program,and are brought in by the instructor, making it easy for schools to use this program from year to year. Performances are an important key to our program and children await them
                            with confidence and enthusiasm. The goal of On pointe dance academy is being accomplished by opening opportunities for all children to explore the world of dance through expression and creativity. Dance is more than the word it is a sport and an art all in one.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Roman started dance at the age of 3 at Leggz Dance Academy. She was introduced to dance by her grandmother who noticed that she needed to release some extra energy. She started off in a creative dance, and in the following years she began to love dance and decided to extend her knowledge into other styles of dance totaling up to 10 classes per week. At the age of 17 she was offered a job to teach dance and at the age of 19 decided to start her own business teaching dance at local schools. She continues with her business which has increased to various schools, and is also teaching at the same dance studio she started at when she was 3.</p>
